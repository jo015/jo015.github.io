        Welcome to my first math webpage, I am going to be looking into 2 choices for my final project.

        <h2>Topic 1</h2>
        
        <h3>Math Class Hub</h3>
        This website would be a central location for all the information needed in my 7th grade math class.  
        It would include the syllabus <a href="Syllabus.html">(Find it here)</a> and the following unit resources:
                <ul>
                <li>Assignments</li>
                <li>Schedules</li>
                <li>Study Guides</li>
                <li>Extra Resources</li>
                </ul>
         
        <hr>
        <h2>Topic 2</h2>
        <h3>Differentiated Resources</h3>
        This website would include resources for my students depending on their levels of understanding and needs.  
        It would assess where they are and then direct them to resources they need.  Students do not all learn at 
        the same rate or the same way.
