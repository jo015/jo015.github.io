<p>Welcome to Mrs. Morelockâ€™s 7th grade math website!  This page you will be the central location for 
     all things students and parents may need for my class.  On the parents tab, you will find information 
     on how to access grades, the 7th grade weekly newsletter, Envisions, and more.  On the Unit tab, students 
     will be able to find all assignments, notes, resources, etc. for each unit.  The teacher tab has information 
     about me and how to contact me.  The calendar tab is our class calendar with all important dates and the 
     syllabus tab has the course syllabus.  
     I hope you find this website useful and if there is anything you need please feel free to contact me! </p>
