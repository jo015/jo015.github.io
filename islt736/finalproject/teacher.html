  <p>My name is Jennifer Morelock and I have been teaching in the Platte County School District since the 2014-15 school year.  
    Prior to coming to Platte County, I have been teaching since the 2005-06 school year.  Throughout that time, I have always 
    taught some form of math.  I received my bachelor’s degree in Middle School Education with an emphasis in Math and Social 
    Studies from Missouri Western State University in May of 2005, my master’s degree in Teacher Leadership from Park University 
    in August of 2017 and am currently working on my Educational Specialist Degree in Technology from The University of Missouri – 
    Columbia.  I spent my K-12 years as a Platte County Pirate and was very excited to have to opportunity to return as a teacher, 
    once a pirate, always a pirate!  </p>
