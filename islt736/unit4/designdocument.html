         <h3>
        Purpose
         </h3>
         <p>
            The purpose of this web site is to create a central location or “hub” for my 7th grade math class.  
            The website will provide all schedules, resources, assignments, and lessons for my students as well as parents. 
             Students will visit this site daily for information pertaining to class.  They will be able to find all 
             information in one spot instead of having to go to shared drives, google classroom, email, etc. to find 
             what they need for class.  Parents can also go to the web site to be informed on what is going on in class or
              how to use technology such as gradebook.
         </p>

        Use Cases     
         </h3>

         <p style=

            Use Case 1 : Review Schedule
           <br> Actor: Student
           <br>
            <br>At any time during the course a student wants to look at the calendar to know what is coming up in class.  
            She goes to the web site and selects the unit she would like to look at the schedule for.  
            Once on the unit page, she can select the schedule.  The student will look through the assignments, quizzes, 
            tests, etc. on the schedule for the unit to know when events are happening throughout the unit.
            <br>
            <br>Alternate Flow 1: The student chooses calendar on the main page and looks through specific days
             when events are happening through multiple units.
         </p>
         <p style=

             Use Case 2: Find Resources 
           <br> Actor: Student
           <br>
            <br>At any time during the course a student wants to find information on the topic being
             studied in class.  The student will go to the current unit and from there may select,
              assignments, study guides, practice tests, notes, or additional resources.  
            The student will select additional resources and choose a link.
            <br>
            <br>Alternate Flow 1: The student chooses assignments and goes to a list of 
            assignments that they will then complete or rework.
            <br>
            <br>Alternate Flow 2: The student chooses study guides and works through a study 
            guide that covers all material from the unit
            <br>
            <br>Alternate Flow 3: The student chooses practice tests and will work through
             an example of a test for the unit.
             <br>
             <br>Alternate Flow 4: The student chooses notes and goes back through lessons
              that have already been taught.
         </p>
         <p style=
         "border: 3px ridge #ff9933; padding: 10px;background: #ffffff">
         Use Case 3: Student Absence 
           <br> Actor: Student
           <br>
            <br>A student misses school but wants to complete the lesson at home so they are not 
            behind when they return.  The student goes to the main page and chooses the link to
             the unit they are on.  The student then goes into the notes section and finds the 
             specific topic.  The student will go through the lesson.  The student will then go
              back to the unit page and go to assignments. 
             The student will complete any assignments they have missed for the day.
            <br>
            <br>Alternate Flow 1: The student goes to the calendar on the main page and 
            looks on the day they are absent.  The calendar will list specifically what 
            was completed on the day.  
            The student can then follow the links within the calendar to the pages.

        Design Concept

            Audience
            
            <br>
            <br>
            The audience for my website will primarily be 7th grade math students, 
            both male and female.  These students are enrolled in the Platte County 
            R-III School District, specifically Barry Middle School.  Barry Middle School 
            is a 5-8 school that is in suburban Kansas City, Missouri.  The students who 
            will be using the website are all given Chromebooks at the start of the school 
            year to use both at school and at home.  They have used them for several years 
            and have a good understanding of the abilities and functions of the tool.
         </p>
         <hr>
         <p>
            Survey<br>
            <br>I asked 5 7th grade students, both male and female, from different classes, a survey.  I explained what the website was about
             and to answer the questions as if they would be getting the website.  These are the questions and responses.
           <dl style="padding-left:10px">
             <dt>How often would you visit the site and why?</dt>
            <dd>4 out of 5 said 3-4 times per week and the reasons were homework help and 
                understanding the lessons better.</dd>
            <dt>How much do you feel like this website would help you and why?</dt>
            <dd>4 out of 5 gave the highest level (a four) and the reasons were questions after school.</dd>
            <dt>Rank each of the items of importance to be on the site:
                   <div style= "padding-left:20px"> Assignments</div>

            <dd>From most to least importance, they were ranked: Assignments, Study Guides, Schedule, Notes, 
                Additional Resources, and Syllabus</dd>
            <dt>Are there any other items you feel are important to include on the site?</dt>
            <dd>Practice tests, videos, and interesting ways to do the classwork were listed as other things to put on the site.</dd>

                <dd>This website has a good layout.  There are several pages that have overall 
                information and then subtopics for each grade.  I will set up my web site the 
                same using units instead of grades.  
                As in all case studies provided, there are many subpages within each unit.</dd>

                <dd>The style of this page is one that I will try to avoid, it is overwhelming with all 
                the colors, fonts, styles, and columns.  As in the case studies, it is easy for students 
                to find specifically what they need as everything is styled similarly, colors and fonts 
                match, and there is a clean design.</dd>

                <dd>This is great example of consistency, I like how everything matches and flows well, 
                the viewer never feels like they have gone to a different web site.  As in the case studies, 
                there are several pages in my web site.  All the pages will be cohesive and flow well.</dd>

                <dd>I do not like the continuous scroll subpages.  It makes it hard to find material.  
                As discussed in the case studies, information is broken down into 
                several subtopics so that there is not too much information on any given page.  </dd>

                    for and links within those pages to other pages.  As mentioned in the case studies, 
                    each page on the website will be clearly labeled as to what the user will find. 
                     The paths to each subtopic is easy to follow. </dd>

     Rational for Organization
     <br>
     <br>
     This website is organized in a way that follows the flow of the course.  
     Each unit link contains the information for that unit.  There are also 
     main page links that make it easy to find what you are looking for.  The 
     students will be able to find information they need and the parents “How to” 
     links are all in one location.  Even if a parent needs information from the 
     student pages, they can use the calendar to find what unit they need to navigate too.

         This website will include:<br><br>
        Videos<br>
        &nbsp; I will create all videos for the parent how to page, and the student resources.  
        The videos will be used to show parents how to access material they might want to see in 
        regard to their students.  The videos for the students will be used to help them better understand 
        the material for the unit.<br><br>
        Images <br>
        &nbsp; All images will either be created by myself or will be used through creative commons and

        understanding of the material.  The image / logo on the header of the pages will be created by myself.<br><br>
        Forms <br> 
        &nbsp; There will be forms that are imbedded into the website, those will be created by myself.  The forms

        Color Scheme and Rationale
         </h3>
         <p>
         The color scheme of my page will consist of oranges, blacks, greys, and whites.  The reasoning behind this 
         is that those are the colors of our school and all school websites share a similar color scheme.  This page is an 
         example of how my color scheme will look. <br><br>
         &nbsp; Headers, footers, and navigation bars will be orange with black writing<br>
         &nbsp; The main background will be white with black writing<br>
         &nbsp; Main Headings will be black with orange writing.<br>
