    <h1>Jennifer Morelock's Website Evaluation Report</h1>
   <h3>Evaluator Participants</h3>
    <p> Evaluator 1: Haley
         <br>
         Haley is a 3rd year teacher in my district.  She was asked to complete the evaluation as a peer. 
             Haley has her own websites that she has created and has successfully used them with her students.  
             She viewed the website on a Windows equipped Surface book, the browser she used was Microsoft Edge Explorer 
             and she was on a Verizon mobile hotspot.
     </p>    
     <p>Evaluator 2: Will
         <br>
            Will is a parent of 2 middle school students.  He was asked to complete the evaluation because of his
             parental involvement with the school.  He is a parent that I could see using the website.  Will completed 
             the evaluation on his child’s district provided Lenovo 11e Chromebook ThinkPad.  He was connected with a broadband 
             connection and used Chrome as a browser.
     </p>
     <p>Evaluator 3: Kate
         <br>
            Kate is a middle school student.  She was asked to complete the evaluation as she would be the 
            primary user of my website.  Kate completed the evaluation on her district provided Lenovo 11e 
            Chromebook ThinkPad.  She was connected to the school’s wifi and used Chrome to view the website.
     </p>

            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>Design
              <br>
                In the design section, all of the evaluators commented that there were not any images 
                or videos.  Of the 3 evaluators, 2 of them commented on the navigation.  One of the evaluators 
                stated that “tabs make it easy to go to any page from any page,” while the other said to, “make
                 it so you can just go back one step instead of all the way back to the start through your navigation.”  
                 There were also comments on the font size being good and the colors looking as though it were supposed 
                 to be a Platte County School District web page.  
            </p>
            <p> Content
                <br>
                    The portion of the evaluation on content had mixed answers, one of the evaluators answered that 
                    there wasn’t any content to evaluate, while the other two based evaluations on what would be on 
                    the pages in the end.  The two who anticipated content both said that it would be useful to the site 
                    visitors.  The student evaluator said, “I would use this to find class stuff,” and the teacher evaluator
                     stated, ”I could see students using this page on a regular basis.”  One of the evaluators did mention
                      that several of the title bars were the same and should match the content on the page and a few of
                       the links aren’t functional.
            </p>
            <p> Credibility
                <br>
                In the final section of credibility, the evaluators all mentioned that there wasn’t much to evaluate. 
                 Most of the pictures and videos haven’t been added yet.  All evaluators said that email / contact 
                 information was present and grammar was good.

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>
            <p>The purpose of this web site is to create a central location or “hub” for my 7th grade math class.  
                All of the evaluators did say that they believe students would use the site to find resources. 
                The three use cases from my design document, a student reviews their schedule, finds resources, and 
                finds materials after an absences are successfully being placed into the website.  The locations 
                from each use case are pages in my actual website.  
                <br><br>One issue that does currently prevent the use cases from being successful is that the material itself 
                isn’t yet on the pages as my evaluators discussed. I will not be able to upload information for all 
                units up front as the time is just not there to create all the resources.  I will have all pages there as students
                need them, but not all material will be in all the units at the completion of the course.  This is an ongoing
                process that will be added to throughout the teaching of each unit.
             </p>
             <h3>Recommended/Planned Changes</h3>
             <p>One comment made by an evaluator was, “Maybe make it so you can just go back one step instead of all 
                 the way back to the start through your navigation.”  To accommodate this, I will have the unit pages 
                 open in new tabs so that a site user can simply go back to the previous tab.  The will make navigation 
                 easier for my users.
                 <br><br>
                The comments in regard to links not functioning and formatting not complete will be corrected prior 
                to submission.  Materials will also be added to address the lack of media, content, and more specifically, 
                the teacher bio.  This will be added to the site so that the users have material to view and use.
                <br><br>    
                One of my peer reviews suggested that I add a navigation bar to the end of the longer pages, so users 
                do not have to scroll back to the top.  I will be doing this on some of the pages.
            </p>
            <h3>Reflection of the Evalution Process</h3>
            <p>In reflecting on the evaluation process, I do believe it was a useful part of creating a website.  
                There are a few things I would change in the process though.  The first thing is that I would have 
                created my own evaluation to better look at the specifics of my page.  I also would have created a more 
                student friendly version for my student evaluator.  Another thing that I would have done differently is 
                ask the questions as more of an interview than just asking them to fill out the form.  I believe that in
                 doing this, I would have been able to ask more questions about the way they were responding. 
                 <br><br> 
                I would have also tried to get more peer reviews from my classmates.  I found these to be very useful 
                as they are creating a website of the same requirements that I am.  They also have a better idea of what 
                to look for in the html. 
                <br><br> 
                In choosing my evaluators, I believe the student and peer teacher were the best choices. 
                 Having the parent do an evaluation was nice, but as they are not my primary user, I could 
                 have had another student.  While the answers on this evaluation were not specific, I think 
                 that if I made the changes mentioned above to the process I could get very useful information from the students.
