    <h1>Borders, Padding, and Margins</h1>
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <p>The body of this page should have a background color
         of #fffdd0, utilze the font family "sans serif," and have margins
        all around of 20 pixels</p>
    <h2>Basic Borders</h2>
    <p class="basic"> This box should have a 2px dashed red boreder all 
        the way to the margins with a minimum height of 30 px.</p>
    <h2>Types of Borders</h2>
    <p class="types">This box should have a minimum height of 100 px, width of 300 px,
        border width of 10 px, the left border should be dashed and red, the right border
        should be dotted and black, the top should be double and purple, and the bottom
        should be groove style with the color orange.
    </p>
    <h2>Cell Padding Example</h2>
    <p class="cell">This box helps you see clearly how cell padding affects placement.  The box 
        itself fills the space from top to bottom and left to right, all the way out to the margins.  
        Cell padding affects the space between the box border and the text within.  For this box, you 
        should have a solid, 5px green border, with padding on the left of 10px, 50px on the right,
        20px on the otp, and 100px on bottom.
    </p>
    <h2>Margin Example</h2>
    <p class="margin">This box helps you see how margins work.  There is not cell padding so the text 
        is right up against the border, but the entire box is pushed away from the sides of the page
        and top/bottom or other elements through margins.  The border should be solid blue at 10px wide,
        with margins at 20px on top, 100px on the right, 200px on the bottom, and 50px on the left.
    </p>
    <h1>Floats and Clears</h1>
    <h2>No Float</h2>
    <section class="none">
        <img src="img/test-image.png">
        <p>In this box, the test image should be all the way in the upper left corder of the box
            with no padding and this text will be directly underneath the image.  The boarder should 
            be 2 pixels, solid blue, a height of 300 pixels, and a width of 500 pixels
        </p>
    </section>
    <h2>Float Left</h2>
    <section class="left">
            <img class = "leftpic" src="img/test-image.png">
            <p>In this box, the test image should be all the way in the upper left corner of the box
                with no padding and this text will be to the right of the image.  The boarder should be 2 
                pixels, solid purple with a height of 300 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
            </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Float Right</h2>
    <section class="right">
            <img class = "rightpic" src="img/test-image.png">
            <p>In this box, the test image should be all the way in the upper rightt corner of the box
                with no padding and this text will be to the right of the image.  The boarder should be 2 
                pixels, solid orange with a height of 300 pixels and a width of 500 pixels.
            </p>
    </section>

    <h2>Float Left With Overflow Hidden</h2>
    <section class="hidden">
            <img class = "leftpic" src="img/test-image.png">
            <p>In this box, the test image should be all the way in the upper left corner of the box
                with no padding and this text will be to the right of the image.  The boarder should be 2 
                pixels, solid orange with a height of 100 pixels and a width of 800 pixels. The overflow 
                should be set to "hidden" so the bottom of the image should be cut off.
            </p>

    <p>The rest of the items covered in this chapter work best with vendor specific prefixes, so we're 
        going to skip them for now!
